<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Now You See Me</h3>
<p>
    It was the first movie that I've seen where every scene felt like a plot twist was going to happen. There's an impressiveness to that which I'll never get back.
</p>
<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>
    For a target audience of children, this movie has themes and plots that transcends the children genre. 
</p>
<h3>The Menu</h3>
<p>
    It's so much more than just being a chef or an own of a restaurant. It's an extreme view of someone who had their passion and talent taken advantage of.
